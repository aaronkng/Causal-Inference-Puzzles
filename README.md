# Causal-Inference-Puzzles
For my contract work, I was tasked with creating three mini-games (sliding puzzle, jigsaw puzzle, and pipe puzzle) that would be integrated into a larger game meant to teach players the concepts of causal inference. I made sure the code was clearly written and well commented so that my contractor could easily integrate the mini-game into the bigger game. 

Make sure to click on each game to read their `README.md`.
