# Goals for this project
The objective of this project was to create three mini-games that could be easily integrated into a larger game meant to teach players the concepts of causal inference. Furthermore, ensured the controls of the game were intuitive to use and made sure the animations being played enhanced user experience. 

# Post-Mortem
- Broke the development process down into simple chunks and would rigoroulsy test the functionality of one function before moving onto the next one. 
- Trying to understand what the most intuitive user controls would be for the player and testing it out myself to ensure user friendliness. 
- Organized the code in such a way that the lead developer would understand the pipeline and would be able to easily integrate the mini-games into the larger game
